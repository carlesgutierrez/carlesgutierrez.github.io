Here some projects I've been making:

<div class="tiles">
{% for post in site.categories.mediaart %}
  {% include post-grid.html %}
{% endfor %}
</div><!-- /.tiles -->

I try to use opensource tools like OpenFrameWorks<www.openframeworks.cc> or Processing<www.processing.org>. You could find in my github repositories<https://github.com/carlesgutierrez> some of the tools/addons I have been using.
