**Melissani Spirit Generator** is an immersive and site-specific interactive art performance held inside the legendary **Melissani Cave** in **Kefalonia, Greece**. Inspired by the mythological tales surrounding the cave, the project reinterprets its spiritual narrative through a multi-sensory, tech-driven experience.

The aim was to extend the human presence in the cave through interactive technology, transforming its subterranean lake and cavern walls into a living environment activated by the audience.

### Core Interactive Elements

- **Mobile Interaction (Android)**  
  Visitors boarded rowboats equipped with Android phones running a custom app. Through the app, they triggered **visual and sonic effects** throughout the cave.

- **Projection Mapping**  
  The rugged surfaces of the cave — its walls and ceiling — were used to display **reactive visual content**, reimagining scenes from the myth with dynamic storytelling.

- **Particle Physics Animation**  
  Generative visuals based on **particle systems** created flowing, ethereal shapes that responded to user inputs, symbolizing spirits and forces of nature.

- **Movement Tracking (Kinect)**  
  A **Kinect sensor** detected audience presence and movement, integrating it into the narrative layer and potentially affecting projections in real time.

- **Performative Lighting & Character Interaction**  
  A live performer, personifying the mythological figure **Pan**, used controlled lighting and gestures to interact with visuals and guide the story.

- **Live Music Performance**  
  Inside the cave, **flutist Wilfrido Terrazas** performed live, weaving music into the spatial and digital choreography.


### Technical Infrastructure

To enable this unique performance, a full **on-site wiring and power system** was installed inside the cave — enabling projections, sensors, mobile interaction, and sound without disrupting the natural environment.


### Community & Artistic Collaboration

The project actively involved the **local community and artists of Kefalonia**, bringing their interpretations of the myth into the performance. The result was a collaborative, evolving artwork that merged **myth, nature, and real-time media**.
