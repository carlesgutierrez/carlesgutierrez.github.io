*The Interactive Sociogram is an installation that reacts to the presence of people passing through the space. The project is an exploratory study of the relationships established between people, particularly when they share the same place, by creating a visual graphic of the links that are created between them.*

*The circles of light represent the nodes of the network created by the participants, and the lines are the eventual links between these nodes. The links that are being visualised can be modulated voluntarily by the users themselves, as they move through the system and change their spatial location relative to the other people.*

*Interactive sociogram is a space for play, allowing you to discover, explore and experience the relationships between people, in a different and original way. It is an immersive space that stimulates the creation of dynamic rituals among participants.*
