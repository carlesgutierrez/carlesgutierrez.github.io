**ChinoPinball** is an experimental media art project developed within the **ChinosInternational** art collective, following a creative coding workshop in 2014. The piece explores the fusion of **urban space**, **projection mapping**, and **game mechanics**, simulating a giant **pinball machine projected on architecture**.

The long-term goal was to scale the installation into large-format public interventions — using building façades or street surfaces as dynamic game fields for playful interaction.

#### Perills Street Test (Barcelona) — 2014  
  The prototype was tested outdoors at **Carrer Perills** thanks to the support of [44Perills sound art association](https://es-es.facebook.com/44Perills), who helped us hack into the local **street lighting** system to integrate light interaction and offer the street as testing ground.
