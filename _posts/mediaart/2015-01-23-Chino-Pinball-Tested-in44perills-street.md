ChinoPinball has been an media art project development with ChinosInteranational art collective, as an experimental project after a Workhop in 2014. The continuation of this project aim to be setup in a giant format for streets or buildings as a huge videomapping. Still experimental was exhibited at:

At least we could test it once at street "Perills", Barcelona. That was a first aproaching at the public space. We figured many issues to solve for future implementations.
In collaboration with [*44Perills sound art association*](https://es-es.facebook.com/44Perills) for their collaboration.
Thanks for  show us how to hack the street lights and offer their piece of street for testing.
