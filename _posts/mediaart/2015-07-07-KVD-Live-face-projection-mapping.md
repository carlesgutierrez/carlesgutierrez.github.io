As a **Creative Technologist** at **Wildbytes**, I took part in the development of this pioneering **real-time face projection mapping** performance for the launch of **Kat Von D Beauty by Sephora**.

I was responsible in collaboration with Nacho Cossio for building the **software pipeline in Unity**, synchronizing **real-time face tracking data** with a **3D head model**, and enabling adaptive videomapping with sub-frame precision. Additionally, I collaborated as a **hardware advisor**, contributing to **projector calibration**, **camera rig alignment**, and optical distortion correction.

The custom software included:
- **Real-time warping and projection mapping**
- **Face texture alignment and lens correction**
- **Video playback control** inside Unity
- **Dynamic shader effects** simulating digital makeup

### System Overview

- 5-camera head tracking system capturing facial movement at 240 fps  
- Unity-based visual engine rendering live on a 3D facial mesh  
- Real-time projection with a digital makeup layer using custom shaders

This performance **transformed Kat Von D‚Äôs face live on stage**, merging makeup artistry with cutting-edge computer vision and immersive technology.
