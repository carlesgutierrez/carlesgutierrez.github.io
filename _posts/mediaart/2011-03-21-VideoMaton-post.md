Interactive piece exhibited in “Habitantes y Paseantes”, at the newly opened City Council building in Plaza Cibeles, Madrid.

The project was developed by Lummo between late 2010 and early 2011. The **technical and artistic direction** was led by Mar Canet and Carles Gutiérrez, with additional technical support from Javi Lloret.

As part of the core team, I contributed both to the artistic and technical development, bringing in my expertise in **computer vision and multithreaded real-time tracking of multiple body parts**. This project stands out as an early example of face mapping, created just before the rise of techniques like deepfake or face substitution.
