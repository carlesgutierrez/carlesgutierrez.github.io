Sculptural vision of a hypercube and conceptualization of the fourth dimension. A cube of dimensions greater than that of the observer is the visualization tool, and it is onto this that we map the hypercube's projections. The enigma lies in the hypercubic structure, where it is not possible to visualize the complete reality of a four-dimensional space in a three-dimensional one. For visualization, we utilize one of the hypercube's rotations. Furthermore, the observer's action interacts with the sculpture, becoming trapped within the faces of its projection, where time passes differently.
