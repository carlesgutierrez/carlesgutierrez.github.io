I`ve studied computer science and code should be my main tool but was not. I had started with OpenCv and I had learned how to use CCTV cameras in my projects thanks to [Theo Watson ViddeoIntput library](http://www.muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/). After that and before to start to put in practice my studies in "serious companies" I deciced to learn by my own. I discovered OF (Openframeworks) a set of coding example really easy and usefull to do what ever you imagine. Then I`ve keep there for a long... Until now. My guess, is that others can do the same. Not only from computer science background, from anywhere >> Artist, Designers, Architecs, kids, and any type of creative person capable to learn. 

So, sometimes, I prepare some workshops about how to Creative Code, Computer Vision and other tools related.

Workshops:

* OF and ComputerVision at Escuelab during Interactivos?09 Magia y Tecnologia. 2009 (4h)
* Love your Code (OF`s good practices) at Espai Erre, Barcelona. 2012 (12h)
* Intro OF & Kinect Camera at CCGuinard'o. 17 Set 2013. (4h)
* OF and Physics Engines at ChinosInternational`s Space, Barcelona. Jan 2014.  (12h)

I've started this workshop's line some time ago with small group of artist in [Hangar](https://hangar.org/en/) at 2011 after this I've decided to keep learning and helping others and to grow this community.
