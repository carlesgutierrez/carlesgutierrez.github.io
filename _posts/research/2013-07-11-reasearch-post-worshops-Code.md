I studied computer science and Multimedia Engineering, and I've did my final project using somr OpenCv. There Ive learned how to use CCTV cameras. Many thanks to [Theo Watson ViddeoIntput library](http://www.muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/). After all, and checking my low skills Ive deciced to learn more by my own, and I've started to follow OF (Openframeworks). OF i'ts a great set of c++ frameworks that aim you to create anything you want in a simple way. This is my guess for anyone. Not only for a computer science background person. There are many other softwares that also works in this way of thinking: Processing (Java), Godot (Pseudo-Python), Blender ...   

Sometimes, I do workshops about: Creative Code, Computer Vision, Engines, Games and others related.

Past workshops:

* OF and ComputerVision at Escuelab during Interactivos?09 Magia y Tecnologia. 2009 (4h)
* Love your Code (OF`s good practices) at Espai Erre, Barcelona. 2012 (12h)
* Intro OF & Kinect Camera at CCGuinard'o. 17 Set 2013. (4h)
* OF and Physics Engines at ChinosInternational`s Space, Barcelona. Jan 2014.  (12h)
* CoderDojo Processing Workshops at Medialab-Prado. Madrid 2015-2016 (1h every Saturday) 
* OF and ofxSensors4Games addoon workshop at Nuclai Artificial Intelligence for Creative Aplications. Viena (4h)

Actual workshops:

* CoderDojo Processing Workshops at Medialab-Prado. Madrid 2016-2017 (2h every Saturday) 
* OpenGames Group. Madrid 2016-2017 (2h every Friday)
