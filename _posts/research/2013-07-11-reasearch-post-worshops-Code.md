I studied computer science and at the end I started to work with OpenCv. I learned how to use CCTV cameras in my projects thanks to [Theo Watson ViddeoIntput library](http://www.muonics.net/school/spring05/videoInput/). After this I deciced to learn by my own following OF (Openframeworks), great c++ frameworks all together that aim you to create anything. This is my guess for anyone. But not only from computer science background: Artist, Designers, Architecs, kids, and any type of creative person are capable to grow in this area. 

Sometimes, I do workshops about: Creative Code, Computer Vision, Engines, Games and others related.

Past workshops:

* OF and ComputerVision at Escuelab during Interactivos?09 Magia y Tecnologia. 2009 (4h)
* Love your Code (OF`s good practices) at Espai Erre, Barcelona. 2012 (12h)
* Intro OF & Kinect Camera at CCGuinard'o. 17 Set 2013. (4h)
* OF and Physics Engines at ChinosInternational`s Space, Barcelona. Jan 2014.  (12h)
* CoderDojo Processing Workshops at Medialab-Prado. Madrid 2015-2016 (1h every Saturday) 
* OF and ofxSensors4Games addoon workshop at Nuclai Artificial Intelligence for Creative Aplications. Viena (4h)

Actual workshops:

* CoderDojo Processing Workshops at Medialab-Prado. Madrid 2016-2017 (2h every Saturday) 
* OpenGames Group. Madrid 2016-2017 (2h every Friday)
