After the Workshop we perform one hour Vjing session for LACOSa. We had prepared a set of contents for each separate layer ( Internal 3 floors and some external walls) that was played at the rithm of Bakalao music. Many thanks for the music to Julio alias @soulseekers. 

LaCosa Mapping was possible thanks to all previous last work done by Eduardo Moriana, Yago Torroja and Enrique Esteban. They found and draw the main LED sheduling.
