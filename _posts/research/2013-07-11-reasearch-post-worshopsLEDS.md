Whorkshop in current development. Since Arduino the uses of electronics and their controllers has been simplified so much. My goal is to keep researching about lighting and help other and the community to build their prototypes.

I've started this workshop's line some time ago with small group of artist in [Hangar](https://hangar.org/en/) at 2011 after this I've decided to keep learning and helping others and to grow this community.
