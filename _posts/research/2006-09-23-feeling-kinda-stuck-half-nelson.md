My gosh! I ate a bowl of generic Honeycomb cereal for lunch and have been starving ever since. Completely devoured the large bucket at Dipson tonight and got a refill of my favorite popcorns before *Half Nelson* even started. Sometimes I wonder if all the old people sitting around me are super artsy and enjoy these filmsâ€¦ or if they just live across from the theater and straggle in to take advantage of a senior citizens discount.
