A collaborative workshop and live VJing performance co-produced with **Beatriz Lorenzo** for **Medialab-Prado**, as part of the **#ViernesOpenLab** program.

During the session, participants learned the fundamentals of **VJing and Video Mapping** using **Resolume Arena**, including layer management, content preparation, and basic projection mapping techniques. The workshop concluded with a demonstration of a real architectural mapping setup, focusing on the iconic staircase structure inside **La Cosa**.

Following the workshop, we delivered a **live VJing session** using predesigned visual content mapped to different architectural zones of the building — including its internal floors and external walls — controlled in real-time.

This audiovisual performance was made possible thanks to the technical groundwork done by **Eduardo Moriana**, **Yago Torroja**, and **Enrique Esteban**, who created the LED structure and projection layout.
