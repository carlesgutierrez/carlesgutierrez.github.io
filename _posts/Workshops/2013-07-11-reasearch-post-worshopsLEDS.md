# Research and Workshops about LEDs and Programmable Electronics

Since Arduino, the use of electronics and their controllers has been simplified so much. My goal is to continue researching lighting and help others and the community build their prototypes.

I started this workshop series some time ago with a small group of artists at [Hangar](https://hangar.org/en/){:target="_blank"} in 2011. After that, I decided to keep learning about electronics and help others along the way.
