Being part of a team for delivery 3D face projection mapping show as part of a live digital makeup performance to launch Sephora’s Kat Von D Beauty where were designed visual effects and digital makeup transformed to face of celebrity tattoo artist Kat Von D.  

Life Face Projection Mapping was built through different tools: 
* The projector renders a 3D model of the performer on stage
* A 5-camera head tracking system that follows the face movements of the performer in real-time, at 240 frames per second.
* Visual effects made by a second layer that overlaid on top of the skin, augmenting it in real-time
