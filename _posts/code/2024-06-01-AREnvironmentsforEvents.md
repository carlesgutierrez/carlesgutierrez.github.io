Throughout 2024, I’ve worked on various **Augmented Reality (AR)** experiences for events and interactive exhibitions. These projects explore both **spatial tracking** and **image-based AR**, creating immersive scenes that enhance audience engagement through mobile and web platforms.


### Spatial AR Experience with Onirix
I developed a mobile AR experience that simulates a **catastrophic scene in outer space**, allowing users to explore and interact with the narrative in real scale. Client: Now Havas.

- **Technology**: Onirix Studio + World Tracking  
- **Use case**: Positioning 3D objects accurately on physical surfaces (ground/space)  
- **Application**: Event installations with immersive storytellingion

## Custom Image Tracking with ARMindJS

I’ve also built smaller AR experiments using **ARMindJS**, a JavaScript library for **custom image-based tracking**, allowing 3D animations to be triggered by visual markers.

- **Technology**: ARMindJS + Three.js / A-Frame  
- **Use case**: Branded AR experiences or educational markers  
- **Features**: Real-time 3D models, animated content on top of physical graphics

These tools offered lightweight and flexible alternatives for mobile-friendly AR projects, especially suited for installations without app requirements.

- **Use Case**: Exploratory tool for image-based medical feedback (non-diagnostic)

These experiences reflect my interest in **real-time 3D environments**, interactive storytelling, and creative use of browser-based technologies for public engagement.
