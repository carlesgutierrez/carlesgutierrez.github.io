A tool created for Medialab-Prado Facade that aims to offer an interactive controller for specific games using multi-tracking input. Output available by OSC protocol. WIP. Only working in windows So for now.

Bad area ligting has been a big computer visio√≥n issue for a long time. Right now there are several solutions by using other kind of object detections. In this case by using Darknet library ( yolo2 ) that works in GPU so it's capable to geve much more accuware results in real time.
